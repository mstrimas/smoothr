#' Jagged polygons for smoothing
#'
#' Spatial polygons in `sf` format for smoothing. Most of these polygons have
#' been created by converting rasters to polygons and therefore consist entirely
#' of right angles. There are examples of polygons with holes and multipart
#' polygons.
#'
#' @format An `sf` object with 9 features and 3 attribute:
#'   - **`type`**: character; the geometry, i.e. "polygon" or "line".
#'   - **`hole`**: logical; whether the polygon has holes or not.
#'   - **`multipart`**: logical; whether the feature is single or multipart.

#' Jagged lines for smoothing
#'
#' Spatial lines in `sf` format for smoothing. There are examples of lines
#' forming a closed loop and multipart lines.
#'
#' @format An `sf` object with 9 features and 3 attribute:
#'   - **`type`**: character; the geometry, i.e. "polygon" or "line".
#'   - **`closed`**: logical; whether the line forms a closed loop or not.
#'   - **`multipart`**: logical; whether the feature is single or multipart.
"jagged_lines"

#' 3D jagged line with Z-dimension for smoothing
#'
#' Spatial lines in `sf` format for smoothing in three dimensions. There are
#' examples of open and closed loops
#'
#' @format An `sf` object with 9 features and 3 attribute:
#'   - **`type`**: character; the geometry, i.e. "polygon" or "line".
#'   - **`closed`**: logical; whether the line forms a closed loop or not.
#'   - **`multipart`**: logical; whether the feature is single or multipart.

#' Simulated raster for polygonizing and smoothing
#'
#' One of the primary applications of this package is for smoothing polygons
#' generated from rasters. This example RasterLayer is meant to be a simulated
#' occurrence probability for a species, consisting of a spatially
#' auto-correlated Gaussian field with values between 0 and 1. This raster is a
#' 25x25 grid of 100 square kilometer cells in a North American centered Alber's
#' Equal Area projection.
